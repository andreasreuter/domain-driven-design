Let's meet us on [nodancemonkey.com](https://www.nodancemonkey.com) - stay tuned for our first kids app and image book.

# Code repository tutorial

I'll give you a tutorial on this code repository.

You can find the Domain Driven Design in several programming languages in the subfolder `languages`.

Sometimes a programming language makes it necessary to respect special patterns. This is why the code sometimes deviates.

You can find the Domain Driven Design divided into several subjects in the subfolder `languages/{programming language}/{subject}`. Thereby the subjects can differ with the programming languages.

Like everything, Domain Driven Design continues to evolve. That's why I will tag the code. I will tag the code by [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
